#
# There are 3 types of data folder which you can specify in Sierra.
# You can choose for yourself which of the 3 classes best fits 
# your structure and you don't have to have entries in all of these
# classes.  You can have multiple folders in each type.
#
# The types are:
#
# 1) Working folder
#
# Working folders are normally used to denote temporary staging 
# areas for data which is not fully processed.  Data from these
# folders will appear in Sierra, but will not be used as part of
# the backup routine.
#
# 2) Primary folder
#
# This is the primary location for processed data.  These folders
# will be included in the set of locations to be backed up with
# the backup script.
#
# 3) Backup folder
#
# These folders will hold secondary copies of data in the primary
# folders. When running backups it will be assumed that the 
# backup location should be the first listed backup folder so the
# order of these folders is important.
#
# When presenting data in Sierra the various folders will be
# searched for a match to a particular run.  The order of this
# searching will be:
#
# 1st Primary folder
# 2nd Working folder
# 3rd Backup folder
#
# Within each group the search order will be the order in which the
# folders are listed.

## WORKING_FOLDER
WORKING_FOLDER 	/data/working_folder1
WORKING_FOLDER 	/data/working_folder2

## PRIMARY_FOLDER
PRIMARY_FOLDER /data/primary_folder1
PRIMARY_FOLDER /data/primary_folder2

## BACKUP_FOLDER
BACKUP_FOLDER /data/backup_folder_used
BACKUP_FOLDER /data/backup_folder_2

## BUDGET_DB_SERVER
# The hostname of the machine which hosts the optional budget
# code database from which valid codes will be looked up.

BUDGET_DB_SERVER	localhost

## BUDGET_DB_NAME
# The name of the database which contains the budget information

BUDGET_DB_NAME		sierra_budget

## BUDGET_DB_USERNAME
